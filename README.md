VLSI-Project
============

This repository is for my VLSI Project for CSCI 562 Applied Algorithms and Data Structures.

All chips that have been tested will be in the chips folder. Currently I am using the hack platform described in the Elements of Computing Systems Book (a.k.a. From Nand to Tetris).

---------------

Added Netlist folder and netlist naming conventions for this project. Code for generating the netlists will be put into that folder.

Added hdl files to project. I am not using my solutions, I pulled from a repository made by lemmingapex. You can download his solutions from his repo at https://github.com/lemmingapex/elements_of_computing_systems.git
